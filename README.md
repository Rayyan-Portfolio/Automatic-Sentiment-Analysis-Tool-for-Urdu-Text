Challenges in Sentiment Analysis for the Urdu Language
The task of conducting sentiment analysis for the Urdu language presented several distinct challenges, primarily attributable to limited resources, linguistic complexities, and the difficulty of adapting conventional NLP methodologies. Below is a summary of the primary obstacles encountered during this project:

1. Lack of Established Urdu Stopword Lists
A significant challenge was the absence of reliable, pre-built stopword lists for Urdu. In contrast to English, where tools such as nltk provide well-defined stopword lists, Urdu lacks such comprehensive resources. Consequently, it became necessary to manually compile stopword lists, a labor-intensive and error-prone process, particularly given the variation in frequently used yet irrelevant words across different dialects and contexts of Urdu.

2. Data Cleaning Complexities
Data cleaning for Urdu posed notable difficulties due to the intricacies of its script. Special consideration had to be given to diacritical marks, punctuation, and instances of mixed script (Urdu and English). Furthermore, colloquial variations in spelling, where the same word may be written differently, added complexity to the task of standardizing the data.

3. Lemmatization Difficulties
The complex morphology of the Urdu language significantly impeded the lemmatization process. Urdu words often have multiple root forms, making it challenging to consistently reduce them to their base forms. Unlike English, where tools like spaCy and WordNet offer robust lemmatizers, Urdu lacks efficient lemmatization resources, which hindered word standardization and adversely affected model performance.

4. Unsatisfactory Word2Vec Performance
Training the Word2Vec model for Urdu yielded suboptimal results, primarily due to the limited size and sparsity of the available corpus. Unlike English, which benefits from extensive pre-trained word embeddings, Urdu lacks such resources. Training custom embeddings for Urdu necessitates a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, and as a result, the model failed to capture meaningful word relationships, impacting downstream tasks such as sentiment classification.

5. Underperformance of Logistic Regression
Traditional machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, exhibited poor performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Factors contributing to this underperformance included an imbalanced dataset (with a higher prevalence of neutral sentiment), sparse feature vectors, and the inability of TF-IDF features to effectively capture the nuances of the Urdu language.

6. Insufficient High-Quality Urdu Datasets
A further challenge was the lack of publicly available, large-scale labeled datasets for Urdu sentiment analysis. While English NLP benefits from substantial datasets such as IMDB or Twitter sentiment data, for Urdu, reliance on smaller, custom-curated datasets limited the ability to train models and achieve robust generalization.

7. Tokenization Challenges
The tokenization of Urdu text was notably more challenging than that of English, as Urdu words are often written without spaces, and the language’s inflectional forms are complex. Standard tokenization tools proved ineffective for Urdu, necessitating the development of custom tokenizers, which required considerable effort and manual tuning.

8. Challenges in Model Evaluation
The evaluation of models was also problematic due to the scarcity of Urdu-specific resources. Unlike English, which has well-established benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis, Urdu lacks such standardized benchmarks. This made it difficult to assess the model’s performance against existing baselines or competing models.

9. Absence of Pre-trained Models and Libraries for Urdu
A critical limitation was the absence of pre-trained language models tailored to Urdu. Although models like BERT and GPT are highly optimized for English and other widely spoken languages, they are not readily applicable to Urdu without significant modification. This restricted the ability to leverage transfer learning, a crucial element in modern NLP.

Conclusion
The process of developing sentiment analysis for the Urdu language was fraught with critical challenges, including the absence of established stopword lists, limited lemmatization tools, tokenization complexities, and insufficient dataset sizes. Moreover, the lack of pre-trained models and the subpar performance of traditional methods like Word2Vec and Logistic Regression further hindered the pursuit of high accuracy. These obstacles emphasize the urgent need for more robust resources, tools, and research in the field of Urdu natural language processing.
